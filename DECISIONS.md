# Comp-Pro-2-project-1
### Created by Kylie Thompson Brielle Hoffman and Hanna Jung
### We are first going to work on user and book management
### created mysql server!
### we have to use java -cp ".;*" librarymanagement because for some reason mysql connector j jar wasnt working 
### things needed for this to work on your computer: mysql workbench, vscode, mysql connect jar (search on java that works on all platforms)
### problems: ISBN is too large to store as in int in the database, so i might have to change it to strings with VARCHAR
### otherwise, user and book management basic version is complete. 


### To do for week three: upload more data, fine calculation, borrowing and returning books inter library loan service, GUI
