### Created by Kylie Thompson Brielle Hoffman and Hanna Jung
#### This file is a duplicate of what it was originally. Original file has been abandoned because someone accidentally deleted hers at her local folder, which messed everything up 
### Files to use in order to run this program:
#### Run librarymanagmeent.java in order to run this library. 
#### Files involved: book.java, bookingdetails.java, BookManagement.java, bookPage.java, booksdatabase.java, database.java, librarymanagement.java, login.java, logindatabase.java
#### we ceated separate database files and a main database file to connect with my sql. 
#### original file with history of commits: https://github.com/bh1423/Comp-Pro-2-project-1
#### We are first going to work on user and book management
#### created mysql server!
#### we have to use java -cp ".;*" librarymanagement because for some reason mysql connector j jar wasnt working 
#### things needed for this to work on your computer: mysql workbench, vscode, mysql connect jar (search on java that works on all platforms)
#### problems: ISBN is too large to store as in int in the database, so i might have to change it to strings with VARCHAR
#### otherwise, user and book management basic version is complete. 


### To do for week three: upload more data, fine calculation, borrowing and returning books inter library loan service, GUI
